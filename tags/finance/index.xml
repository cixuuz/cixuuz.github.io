Statement of Financial Position Statement of Financial Position, also known as the Balance Sheet, presents the financial position of an entity at a given date. It is comprised of the following three elements:
Assets: Something a business owns or controls (e.g. cash, inventory, plant and machinery, etc) Liabilities: Something a business owes to someone (e.g. creditors, bank loans, etc) Equity: What the business owes to its owners. This represents the amount of capital that remains in the business after its assets are used to pay off its outstanding liabilities.</description>
